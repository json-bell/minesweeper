# Minesweeper

I coded this during the fundamentals section of my time at Northcoders - having done the HTML and CSS introduction day during the introduction week, I was intrigued to see what I could code using just the Object Oriented Programming skills I was learning, since front and back end parts came later in the course.

I used HTML buttons for almost all of the user input, with JavaScript run in a browser as backend modifying CSS tags and HTML blocks when certain events triggered. I also used the tiniest bit of event handling to detect whether the shift button was pressed, so that I could have two inputs - one for revealing squares, one for flagging a potential mine.

This deepend my familiarity with Object Oriented programming: having one class for the minesweeper grid, which is generated each time a new game is started, and one for every single cell of the game, made me appreciate the ease of use of methods, especially when it comes to making sure data is sufficiently passed.

I'm planning to look back on this project at the end of the course, more to look at how far I'll have come than to edit the previous code. I know that by the end I will have gained many more skills, and will know more about what makes good quality code: I'll surely see lots of slip ups that can be improved. I realise I do not yet have the experience needed to make more comments on this, but can also see that this is precisely because I have lots of space to grow into as a developer :)
