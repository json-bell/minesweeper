# Minesweeper

I coded this during the fundamentals section of my time at Northcoders - having done the HTML and CSS introduction day during the introduction week, I was intrigued to see how much I could code without relying on the front and back end skills which I'll develop during the corresponding parts of the course.

As always, searching documentation for HTML button functions and using the briefest amount of event handling for different clicks to differentiate between searches and flag placements.

This project came in the midsts of our introduction to Object Oriented Programming - the practice I got from using classes and methods appropriately will continue to build my programming skills.

I believe this project will also show me how far I will have come - going from HTML buttons to React and other front-end systems will surely show the improvements I have gone through while coding
